    Building this whole set is counter-productive, and not likely to be what
    is desired.

    You can build the `-A build.default` attribute to build an empty and
    un-configured image. That image can be configured using `local.nix`.
    **Note that an unconfigured image may appear to hang at boot.**

    An alternative is to use one of the `examples` system. They differ in their
    configuration. An example that should be building, and working using
    cross-compilation is the `examples/hello` system. Read its README for more
    information.

     $ nix-build examples/hello --argstr device ${final_device} -A build.default
